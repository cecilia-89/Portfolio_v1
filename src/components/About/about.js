                        My journey as a developer began with a love for technology and a curiosity for how things work.
                        I recently completed a one-year ALX program in software engineering and trust me it was an exhilarating experience.  The program challenged me to think critically and develop innovative solutions to complex problems, 
                        over the course of the program, I've honed my skills in Express.js, Redis,
                        React.js, Node.js, Flask, Django, JavaScript, Ruby on Rails and more.
                    </div>
                        
                    <p>
                        In my spare time, you can find me exploring new technologies, reading tech blogs or romance novels ðŸ™ˆ (don't judge me).
                        It is with great enthusiasm and eagerness that I anticipate the prospect of continuing to develop and enhance my proficiency as a full-stack developer, 
                        while simultaneously making meaningful contributions to the dynamic and constantly evolving realm of web development.
